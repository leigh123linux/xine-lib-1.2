<title>What does this text do ?</title>
<para>
This document should help xine hackers to find their way through
xine's architecture and source code. It's a pretty free-form document
containing a loose collection of articles describing various aspects
of xine's internals. It has been written by a number of people who work
on xine themselves and is intended to provide the important concepts and
methods used within xine. Readers should not consider this document to be
an exhausative description of the internals of xine. As with all projects
which provide access, the source-code should be considered the definative source
of information.
</para>

<para>
This document has no intention to be, and therefore never will be, complete or
current in any way. Instead it should be considered a read-map pointing the
casual hacker to the correct location in the xine source.
