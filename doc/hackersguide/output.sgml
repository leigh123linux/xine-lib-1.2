   <title>General principle of post plugins</title>
   <para>
    The name "post plugin" comes from "postprocessing" which already describes
    what these plugins are supposed to do: they take video frames, audio
    buffers or subpicture planes as they leave the decoders and apply arbitrary
    processing to them. Then they pass processed elements on to the output
    loops. Post plugins can not only be chained to process the predecessor's
    output and advance the data to their successor, they can form arbitrary trees,
    since post plugins can have any number of inputs and outputs. Additionally,
    the interconnection of the plugins currently inserted in such a tree can
    be changed on the fly during playback. The public function
    <function>xine_post_wire()</function> is used by frontends to form such
    connections.
   </para>
   <para>
    Due to the variety of possible applications, the interface post plugins have
    to implement is just the basic foundation. The complexity comes from hooking
    your post plugin into the engine data paths for video frames and audio buffers,
    intercepting the data and performing your operation on them. This is done by
    taking the interface of a video or audio port, replacing some of the functions
    with your own ones and passing the interface to the decoder or predecessor
    post plugin that is going to feed you with data by accessing this interface
    and by doing that, calling the functions you provide. From there you can do
    almost anything you want. Constructing video frames from audio buffers to
    visualize sound is possible as well as just outputting an integer giving the
    average brightness of an image. It is also possible to invent post plugins
    with no output (not very useful, unless the plugin has some side-effect) or
    no input at all; for the latter you have to create your own pthread, otherwise
    your plugin will not do anything. An audio signal generator could be
    implemented like this. The various data types, post plugins can
    accept as input or offer as output are defined in <filename>xine.h</filename>
    as <varname>XINE_POST_DATA_*</varname> defines.
   </para>
   <para>
    Some terminology used in the following explanations:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <varname>down direction</varname>:
       The direction from the decoders to the output. This is the way video or audio
       data (actual content and meta information) usually travels through the engine.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <varname>up direction</varname>:
       The direction from the output to the decoders. This is the way some video or audio
       metadata like metronom timestamps travel through the engine.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <varname>interception</varname>:
       Post plugins are inserted into the engine data paths by the means of the decorator
       design pattern. This works by taking engine structures with member funtions like
       video or audio ports, video frames or overlay managers and inserting your own functions
       into a copy of this structure. This is called interception. This modified structure
       is then passed up to the plugin that uses it and thus calls your replaced functions.
      </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>Writing a xine post plugin</title>
   <para>
    The post plugin API is declared in <filename>src/xine-engine/post.h</filename>
    The plugin info of post plugins contains the post plugin type, which is one of the
    <varname>XINE_POST_TYPE_*</varname> defines and the init_class function of the plugin.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post_plugin_t *open_plugin(post_class_t *class_gen, int inputs, xine_audio_port_t **audio_target, xine_video_port_t **video_target);</programlisting>
    Returns an instance of the plugin. Some post plugins evaluate <varname>inputs</varname>
    to open a variable number of inputs. Since almost all post plugins have audio or video
    outputs, you can hand in a NULL-terminated array of ports to connect to these outputs.
    In this function you can also intercept these ports so that your plugin is actually used.
    There is a helper function to initialize a <type>post_plugin_t</type>, which you are
    encouraged to use: <function>_x_post_init()</function>.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char *get_identifier(post_class_t *class_gen);</programlisting>
    This function returns a short identifier describing the plugin.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char *get_description(post_class_t *class_gen);</programlisting>
    This function returns a plaintext, one-line string describing the plugin.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void dispose(post_class_t *class_gen);</programlisting>
    This function frees the memory used by the video out plugin class object.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <type>post_plugin_t</type> structure contains the publicly visible
    part of the post plugin with the audio and video inputs and the type of
    the post plugin. Not publicly visible are the lists of all inputs and outputs,
    the <function>dispose()</function> function and some internal stuff which
    plugins do not have to worry about.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void dispose(post_plugin_t *this_gen);</programlisting>
    This function frees the memory used by the plugin instance, but not necessarily
    immediately. Since post plugins enter their own functions into engine structures,
    they might still be needed when <function>dispose()</function> is being called.
    They maintain a usage counter to detect that. To check for such a condition, you
    should use the <function>_x_post_dispose()</function> helper function like that:
    <programlisting>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (_x_post_dispose(this))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really_free(this);</programlisting>
    <function>_x_post_dispose()</function> frees any ressources allocated by any of the 
    post plugin helper functions and returns boolean true, if the plugin is not needed
    any more.
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <title>Interception</title>
   <para>
    Currently, we have four engine structures which can be intercepted by post plugins:
    video ports, video frames, overlay managers and audio ports. You could do this
    interception manually, but since this is quite a complex process, there are helper
    functions to assist you and their usage is encouraged.
   </para>
   <sect3>
    <title>Intercepting a video port</title>
    <para>
     <programlisting>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post_video_port_t *_x_post_intercept_video_port(post_plugin_t *post,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xine_video_port_t *port, post_in_t **input, post_out_t **output);</programlisting>
     This function will intercept <varname>port</varname> and returns a structure
     for you to pass up. All functions in the port will be replaced with dummy
     pass through functions that do nothing but relaying the call down to the original
     port. If you want (that is, <varname>input</varname> or <varname>output</varname> are
     not NULL), this function will also create the input and output descriptors complete
     with rewiring functions and add them to the relevant lists.
     This is required, if you want this port to be advertised by the plugin to the outside world.
    </para>
    <para>
     <type>post_video_port_t</type> makes a variety of interception schemes very easy.
     If you want to replace any of the default functions with your own, just enter it
     into <varname>new_port</varname>. You can use <varname>original_port</varname>
     from within your function to propagate calls down to the original port.
     The constraint is that your functions have to ensure that every original
     port held open scores one usage counter point, so that opened ports are always
     closed before the plugin is disposed. Therefore, you should use the macro
     <function>_x_post_inc_usage()</function> before calling
     <function>original_port-&gt;open()</function> and use the macro
     <function>_x_post_dec_usage()</function> after calling
     <function>original_port-&gt;close()</function>. Note that <function>_x_post_dec_usage()</function>
     might dispose the plugin, when <function>dispose()</function> has been called
     earlier and usage count drops to zero, so do never touch plugin structures after
     <function>_x_post_dec_usage()</function>. In addition, you must never call a port
     function of the original port when the port is not open.
    </para>
    <para>
     Intercepting video frames or the overlay manager of the port is even easier.
     You do not have to reimplement <function>get_frame()</function> or
     <function>get_overlay_manager()</function>. Just enter a <varname>intercept_frame</varname>
     or <varname>intercept_ovl</varname> function which returns boolean true, if
     you want to intercept. The functions to insert in the intercepted frame or overlay
     manager are taken from <varname>new_frame</varname> and <varname>new_manager</varname>
     respectively. Note that the defaults are reversed: If you do not enter such a
     decision function for either one, all frames and no overlay manager will be intercepted.
    </para>
    <para>
     For convenience <type>post_video_port_t</type> also contains pointers to the
     current stream and to the current post plugin and a user_data pointer, where you
     can put in anything you need in addition. If your port is used by more than one
     thread, you can also enforce locking on the port, frame or overlay manager level
     by entering a lock into <varname>port_lock</varname>, <varname>frame_lock</varname> or
     <varname>manager_lock</varname> respectively.
    </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>Intercepting an audio port</title>
    <para>
     Audio port interception is just a stripped down version of video port interception.
     Everything related to frames and overlay manager is not needed and audio buffers
     do not need to be intercepted, since they have no member functions. Everything else
     of the above still applies.
    </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>Intercepting overlay manager</title>
    <para>
     <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void _x_post_intercept_overlay_manager(video_overlay_manager_t *original, post_video_port_t *port);</programlisting>
     Interception of the overlay manager is done automatically when your
     <function>intercept_ovl()</function> decision function returns boolean true.
     Should you ever decide not to use that, interception can be done with this helper
     function, which simply creates an intercepted overlay manager with dummy
     pass through functions in <varname>port-&gt;new_manager</varname> and stores the original
     manager in <varname>port-&gt;original_manager</varname>.
    </para>
    <para>
     No matter how you intercepted the overlay manager, your own replacement
     functions will receive <varname>port-&gt;new_manager</varname> as the overlay manager
     argument. But you most likely want to have access to the <type>post_video_port_t</type>
     from within your functions. For that, there exists a pointer retrieval function:
     <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post_video_port_t *_x_post_ovl_manager_to_port(video_overlay_manager_t *manager);</programlisting>
    </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3>
    <title>Intercepting a video frame</title>
    <para>
     <programlisting>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vo_frame_t *_x_post_intercept_video_frame(vo_frame_t *frame, post_video_port_t *port);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vo_frame_t *_x_post_restore_video_frame(vo_frame_t *frame, post_video_port_t *port);</programlisting>
     Interception of video frames is done automatically when your
     <function>intercept_frame()</function> decision function returns boolean true or
     when there is no such function in <type>post_video_port_t</type>.
     Should you ever decide not to use that, interception can be done with the helper
     function <function>_x_post_intercept_video_frame()</function>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Since the same video frame can be in use in the decoder and in the output and in
     any post plugin in between at the same time, simply modifying the frame
     structure does not work, because every user of the frame needs to see his version
     and the frame must always travel along the same path through the plugins for its
     entire lifetime. To ensure that, <function>_x_post_intercept_video_frame()</function>
     provides a shallow copy of the frame structure with the original frame attached to
     <varname>copy-&gt;next</varname>. This copy will be filled with your own
     frame functions from <varname>port-&gt;new_frame</varname> and with dummy pass
     through functions for those you did not provide. This way, every part of xine
     using this frame will see its own frame structure with a list of frame
     contexts from down the data path attached to <varname>frame-&gt;next</varname>.
     <function>_x_post_restore_video_frame()</function> reverses this and should be
     used when the frame is freed or disposed.
    </para>
    <para>
     Your own replacement functions will receive the copied frame as as argument.
     But you most likely want to have access to the <type>post_video_port_t</type>
     from within your functions. For that, there exists a pointer retrieval function:
     <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post_video_port_t *_x_post_video_frame_to_port(vo_frame_t *frame);</programlisting>
     The constraint is that your functions have to ensure that every intercepted
     frame scores one usage counter point, so that these frames are always
     freed or disposed before the plugin is disposed. Therefore, you should use the macro
     <function>_x_post_inc_usage()</function> before calling
     <function>_x_post_intercept_video_frame()</function> and use the macro
     <function>_x_post_dec_usage()</function> after calling
     <function>_x_post_restore_video_frame()</function>. Note that <function>_x_post_dec_usage()</function>
     might dispose the plugin, when <function>dispose()</function> has been called
     earlier and usage count drops to zero, so do never touch plugin structures after
     <function>_x_post_dec_usage()</function>.
    </para>
    <para>
     From within your own frame functions, you can propagate calls to the original
     frame by calling a function on <varname>frame-&gt;next</varname>. Since
     modifications to the frame can travel both upwards and downwards (decoders and
     output can modify the frame), changes need to be copied between the frame
     structure contexts. You should use the <function>_x_post_frame_copy_down()</function>
     and <function>_x_post_frame_copy_up()</function> helper functions like that:
     <programlisting>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_x_post_frame_copy_down(frame, frame-&gt;next);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame-&gt;next-&gt;draw(frame-&gt;next, stream);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_x_post_frame_copy_up(frame, frame-&gt;next);</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     If your post plugin modifies the content of the frame, you have to modify
     a deep copy of the frame, because the decoder might still use the frame as
     a reference frame for future decoding. The usual procedure is:
     <programlisting>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modified_frame = port-&gt;original_port-&gt;get_frame(port->original_port, ...);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_x_post_frame_copy_down(frame, modified_frame);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy_and_modify(frame, modified_frame);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skip = modified_frame-&gt;draw(modified_frame, stream);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_x_post_frame_copy_up(frame, modified_frame);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modified_frame-&gt;free(modified_frame);</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     When the output receives a frame via <function>draw()</function>,
     it usually receives the stream where the frame
     originates as well and modifies the state of this stream by passing
     the frame through the stream's metronom. Sometimes this is unwanted.
     For example, when you pass the same frame to the output more than once, it
     will confuse metronom. To solve this, you can call
     <function>frame-&gt;next-&gt;draw()</function> with NULL as the stream.
     You might also want to prevent frames from being passed down to the output
     completely, because your post plugin creates something else from these frames,
     but does not need them to be drawn. In both these situations, you have
     to call the helper function <function>_x_post_frame_u_turn()</function>
     when the frame is drawn, because this does some housekeeping which the
     decoder might expect to take place.

   <title>Writing a xine video out plugin</title>
   <para>
    The video out plugin API is declared in <filename>src/xine-engine/video_out.h</filename>
    The plugin info of video out plugins contains the visual type, priority,
    and the init_class function of the plugin.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <varname>visual_type</varname> field is used by xine to
    determine if the GUI used by the client is supported by the plugin
    (e.g. X11 output plugins require the GUI to be running under the
    X Windowing system) and also to determine the type of information passed to the 
    <function>open_plugin()</function> function as its <varname>visual</varname> parameter.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char *get_description(video_driver_class_t *this_gen);</programlisting>
    This function returns a plaintext, one-line string describing the plugin.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char *get_identifier(video_driver_class_t *this_gen);</programlisting>
    This function returns a shorter identifier describing the plugin.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void dispose(video_driver_class_t *this_gen);</programlisting>
    This function frees the memory used by the video out plugin class object.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vo_driver_t *get_instance(video_driver_class_t *class_gen, const void *visual);</programlisting>
    Returns an instance of the plugin.
    The <varname>visual</varname> is a pointer to a visual-dependant
    structure/variable. For example, if you had previously claimed your
    plugin was of the VISUAL_TYPE_X11 type, this would be a pointer
    to a <type>x11_visual_t</type>, which amongst other things hold the 
    <type>Display</type> variable associated with the
    X-server xine should display to. See plugin source-code for other
    VISUAL_TYPE_* constants and associated structures. Note that this
    field is provided by the client application and so if you wish to add another visual
    type you will either need to extend an existing client or write a new
    one.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uint32_t get_capabilities(vo_driver_t *this_gen);</programlisting>
    Returns a bit mask describing the output plugin's capabilities.
    You may logically OR the <varname>VO_CAP_*</varname> constants together to get
    a suitable bit-mask (via the '|' operator).
   </para>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int get_property(vo_driver_t *self, int property);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void get_property_min_max(vo_driver_t *self, int property, int *min, int *max);</programlisting>
    Handle the getting, setting of properties and define their bounds. 
    Valid property IDs can be found in the <filename>video_out.h</filename>
    header file.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int gui_data_exchange(vo_driver_t *self, int data_type, void *data);</programlisting>
    Accepts various forms of data from the UI (e.g. the mouse has moved or the
    window has been hidden). Look at existing plugins for examples of data
    exchanges from various UIs.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vo_frame_t *alloc_frame(vo_driver_t *self);</programlisting>
    Returns a pointer to a xine video frame.
    Typically the video plugin will add private fields to the end of the
    <type>vo_frame_t</type> structure which are used for internal purposes by the plugin.
   </para>
   <para>
    The function pointers within the frame structure provide a mechanism for the
    driver to retain full control of how the frames are managed and rendered to. If
    the VO_CAP_COPIES_IMAGE flag was set in the plugins capabilities then the
    copy field is required and will be called sequentially for each 16-pixel high
    strip in the image. The plugin may then decide, based on the frame's format, how
    this is copied into the frame.

    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void update_frame_format(vo_driver_t *self, vo_frame_t *img, uint32_t width, uint32_t height, double ratio, int format, int flags);</programlisting>
    This function will be called each time the colour-depth/space or size of a frame changes.
    Typically this function would allocate sufficient memory for the frame, assign the pointers
    to the individual planes of the frame to the <varname>base</varname> field of the
    frame and perform any driver-specific changes.

   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void display_frame(vo_driver_t *self, vo_frame_t *vo_img);</programlisting>
    Renders a given frame to the output device.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void overlay_end(vo_driver_t *self, vo_frame_t *vo_img);</programlisting>
    These are used to blend overlays on frames. <function>overlay_begin()</function> is called,
    when the overlay appears for the first time, <function>overlay_blend()</function> is then
    called for every subsequent frame and <function>overlay_end()</function> is called, when
    the overlay should disappear again.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int redraw_needed(vo_driver_t *self);</programlisting>
    Queries the driver, if the current frame needs to be drawn again.
   </para>
   <para>
    <programlisting>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void dispose(vo_driver_t *self);</programlisting>
    Releases all resources and frees the plugin.
