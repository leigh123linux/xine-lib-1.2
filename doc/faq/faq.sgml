  <title>General questions about xine and this document</title>

  <sect1>

    <title>What is the xine engine?</title>

    <para> 
      The xine engine is a free media player engine. It comes in the form of
      a shared libarary and is typically used by media player frontends
      and other multimedia applications for playback of multimedia streams
      such as movies, radio/tv network streams, DVDs, VCDs.
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    
    <title> What's the aim and scope of this text? </title>

    <para>
      The primary goal of this FAQ is to cover all recurring questions related
      to the xine engine. Frontend specific questions are not covered here.
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title> My question is not yet covered here - where can I ask for help? </title>

    <para>
      First of all be sure that your question is really not covered here and
      that you haven't just been a bit too lazy to read through all of this
      text. ;-). Also check out the xine HOWTO and documentation specific to
      the frontend (e.g. <command> xine-ui </command> or <command> gxine </command> or 
      <command> totem </command>).
    </para>
    
    <para>
      That said - you are welcome to mail to our user mailing list:
    
      <email>xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net</email>

      Please provide some info about your setup so people have a chance to
      help you, e.g. include information about your audio/video hardware
      and drivers you use, operating system, cpu type and some console
      output/any error messages. Also include command line parameters you
      have specified and information about the type of stream you're
      trying to play back. Also very important is the version of xine
      you're using and information about any additional plugins you
      may have installed on your system.
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title> What are those xine-lib, xine-ui, gxine, ... modules in cvs for? </title>

    <para>
      Some time ago xine just became too complex to be just one big program.
      Therefore it was split into two major parts.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      xine-lib is simply speaking the engine of xine. It contains all plugins
      and is necessary to run anything that relies on xine (this is the part that
      is covered in this FAQ).
    </para>

    <para>
      Then there are frontends - applications that use xine. The most
      common frontend is that of a media player. There are currently
      two frontends being developed in the xine project, xine-ui (skinned
      dvd-player style frontend directly based on xlib) and gxine,
      a desktop media-player style frontend using the standard gtk widget set
      and comes with a mozilla browser plugin.
      External projects like sinek and totem develop additional frontends.
      In the future you will likely see more and different types of apllications
      being developed which will use the xine engine for video processing
      and other multimedia purposes.
    <para>

    <para>
      If you simply want a media/dvd player, you'll need to install xine-lib
      first and then choose and install a player frontend like xine-ui or gxine.
    </para>

    <para>
      Other modules in CVS: <filename>xine-plugin</filename> a mozilla browser plugin
      for streaming media playback using xine, <filename>xine-www</filename> the
      xine project website sources.
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title> Where and how do I get the latest development version? </title>

    <para>
      Be advised that end-users should stick to the official xine releases.
      CVS is only intended for developers.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      To check out xine-modules from CVS, first do this:
    </para>
    <para>
     <command> cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.xine.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine login </command>
     [empty password]
    </para>
    <para>
      then, to check out individual modules (e.g. <filename>xine-lib</filename>, 
      <filename>gxine</filename>, <filename>xine-ui</filename>):
    </para>
    <para>
    <command>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.xine.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine co modulename</command>
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title> Where can I find pre-compiled binaries, e.g. RPMs? </title>

    <para>
      The xine project does not provide pre-compiled binaries for legal
      reasons (some parts of xine may be covered by patents in some countries).
      Some OS projects/vendors (e.g. debian, freebsd, ...) offer binaries
      for their distributions - please contact them for further info.
      You can also find links to third parties providing xine RPMs on
      the xine homepage.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      See the next chapter of this FAQ for instructions on how to build xine
      from source.
    </para>

  <title> Building and installing xine from source </title>

  <sect1>

    <title> What do I need to compile everything properly? </title>

    <para>
      First of all an official and stable release of gcc. Also be aware 
      that patched gcc versions may break parts of xine and are therefore 
      not supported by the xine project.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Furthermore you'll have to use GNU make to compile xine. On most GNU/Linux
      systems "make" is GNU make - on other platforms use "gmake" instead.
      Also, zlib iss required (including the appropriate header files, which are
      often found in a package called zlib-devel or similar.)
    </para>

    <para>
      If you want to compile xine from CVS, you'll need to have the autobuild tools
      installed (automake, autoconf and libtool - in recent versions).
    </para>

    <para>
      Frontends might need additional libraries, e.g. for gxine you'll need to have
      GTK installed. Make sure you have not only the shared libraries themselves
      but also the header files (often packaged seperately as so-called -dev packages)
      on your system.
    </para>

    <para>
      Some plugins that come with the xine engine need additional libraries (otherwise
      they will not be built). For example, libogg and libvorbis (plus their include files)
      are needed for ogg/vorbis support. 
    </para>

    <para>
      Don't worry about this too much right now, xine's <command>configure</command>
      (see below) will check for all the stuff needed and will tell you what's missing
      (which means that you should check the output it produces carefully ;) )
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title> How do I compile xine? </title>

    <sect2>
    
      <title> Simple build instructions for beginners </title>

      <para>
        Download the latest xine-lib and gxine/xine-ui tarballs, then follow
        these instruction. To unpack a tarball, use:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
        tar xfvz tarballname.tar.gz
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        The following instructions will install xine in <filename>/usr/local</filename> for all
        users. You need root privileges to do this on most systems.
      </para>
      <para>
        First unpack xine-lib, then:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
        ./configure
	make install
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        Make sure your <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> contains 
	<filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>, then:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
        ldconfig
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        Now unpack your frontend (gxine or xine-ui or ...), then:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
        ./configure
	make install
      </programlisting>

    </sect2>    

    <sect2>
    
      <title> Complete build instructions </title>

      <para>
        The build process is the same for all of the xine modules.
      </para>
      <para>
        You have to start with xine-lib. If built and installed successfully, you
        can continue with the frontend(s).
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have installed xine-lib to a non-standard prefix, make sure you
        that you have <filename>$prefix/bin</filename> in your PATH and that your linker finds
        libs in <filename> $prefix/lib </filename> - otherwise trying to build modules that
        rely on xine-lib will fail with configure complaining about not
        finding certain parts of libxine. Using bash you can do something like:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
      export PATH="$prefix/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$prefix/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        to make sure libxine can be found by the frontend(s).
      </para>
      <para>
        Last but not least. Here the build instructions. As stated earlier,
        those are the same for every xine module.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
      ./cvscompile.sh [-> *only* if you checked your sources out of CVS]
      ./configure
      make
      make install
      </programlisting>

    </sect2>    

  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title> Making your own RPM packages (xine-lib, xine-ui) </title>

    <para>
      Basically you will only have to issue one command, if you have just
      downloaded a source tarball from our web site:
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <command> rpm -ta THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_SOURCE_TAR_BALL </command>
    </para>
    
    <para>
      This will start the binary and source RPM building. After compiling is
      finished, a binary rpm is placed in your rpm binary directory which is
      usally <filename>/usr/src/RPM/RPMS/[YOUR_ARCHITECTURE]</filename> and a source RPM is written
      to your rpm source dir (e.g. <filename>/usr/src/RPM/SRPMS</filename>).
    </para>
    
    <para>
      In case that you have a fresh CVS checkout, you will need to do the
      following first in order to get a tarball release out of it which you
      can later use with the <command> rpm -ta </command> command above:
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <command> ./cvscompile.sh && make clean && make dist </command>
    </para>
    
    <para>
      In any case, please keep in mind that you have to build and install
      xine-lib first before you can proceed with xine-ui.
    </para>

  <sect1>

    <title> Can I provide additional CFLAGS for compilation? </title>

    <para>
      Yes, you can do so by setting the CFLAGS variable and then run
      configure again.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      This can be useful to specify additional include paths or library paths
      to the compiler.
    </para>

    <para>
      Example: <command> export CFLAGS="-I/usr/include -L/home/guenter/xine_libs" </command>
    </para>

    <title> Are there binaries for my AMD K7 (Athlon (TM) ) available? Can I build them? </title>

    <para>
      If you have a recent gcc you can try to compile "more" k7 support in (esp.
      better instruction scheduling). If the configure script should fail to
      detect your processor/gcc correctly, try setting the xine_BUILD envvar
      explicitly to a valid description string for your configuration, e.g.
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>
    export xine_BUILD=k7-pc-linux-gnu
    rm -f config.cache
    ./cvscompile.sh
    make
    make install
    </programlisting>

    <sect2>

      <title> The package doesn't compile at all! </title>

      <para>
        In order to be able to compile xine-lib, you need (amongst other things)
        the zlib compression library plus the appropriate headers, which are
        often found in a package called zlib-devel or similar.
      </para>
    
      <para>
        Read again carefully the output <command>./configure</command>
	produced and/or compiler warnings and error reports, they often contain
	helpfull information to find out what's going on. If you're stuck here
	and decide to post your problem on the xine-user mailing list,
	make sure you include these outputs.
      </para>

    <sect2>

      <title> The Xv video-out plugin fails to compile! </title>

      <para>
        If you want to have Xv support compiled in, make sure you either have
        a shared Xv library on your system, e.g. 
	<command> ls /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv* </command>
        should give you some .so libs, like this:
        <programlisting>
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.a
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.so
          /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.so.1
        </programlisting>
      </para>
    
      <para>
        Alternatively you need to have libtool 1.4 or newer installed. If not
        and you only got libXv.a you can create the shared versions yourself:
        <programlisting>
          ld --whole-archive -shared -o libXv.so.1 libXv.a
          ln -s libXv.so.1 libXv.so
          ldconfig
        </programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>
        Now you should be ready to build the Xv video-out plugin on your system.
      </para>

    <title> Build problems: frontend (gxine/xine-ui/...) </title>

    <sect2>

      <title> I have installed xine-lib but the frontend complains about not finding it!</title>

      <para>
        First of all take a closer look at the compilation instructions above again. 
	You will probably find your answer there right away.
      </para>
    
      <para>
        As stated there (there again that hint *grin*), make sure that you
        have <filename> $prefix/bin </filename> in your path and that your 
	linker is able to find
        libraries installed in <filename>$prefix/lib</filename> (by the way, $prefix is where you
        installed your xine-lib to earlier (yes, installing xine-lib with
        <command> make install </command> would be a good idea before trying to compile 
	the frontend ;)).
      </para>

    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>

    <title> Can I install xine in my home directory (without being root) ? </title>

    <para>
      yes. first set up a subdir where you install your private software, eg
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      $ mkdir ~/usr
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      then you have to set a few environment variables - it's probably a good
      idea to add this to your <filename> ~/.bashrc </filename> (or somewhere similar):
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      export PATH="$HOME/usr/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
      export CFLAGS="-I$HOME/usr/include -L$HOME/usr/lib -O3"
      export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I $HOME/usr/share/aclocal"
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      now you can unpack tarballs e.g. in <filename>~/usr/src</filename> 
      (<command>mkdir  ~/usr/src</command> if necessary) and do a
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr
      $ make install
    </programlisting>

    <title>DVD Playback with xine</title>

    <sect2>

      <title>How do I play back DVDs with xine?</title>
  
      <para>
        Newer xine (1.0.x) releases come with a full-featured
        DVD plugin that should be able to handle any unencrypted,
        non-locked DVD with full menu navigation support. No external
        plugins are required anymore here.
      </para>

      <para>
        To get DVD playback working, first make sure you have
        a symlink <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> pointing to your
        DVD device on your system. For example, if your DVD drive
        is the master ide drive on the second IDE channel,
        <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> should point to
        <filename>/dev/hdc</filename>. Please note that if you
        are using the ide-scsi emulation on your system, it is
        likely that you dvd drive got mapped to a scsi device
        node even though it is an ide drive. In that case first
        check out you boot/kernel logs (or run <command> cdrecord -scanbus </command>)
        to find out which device it got mapped to and set the
        symlink accordingly (should be something like <filename>/dev/scd0</filename>,
        <filename>/dev/scd1</filename>, ... in that case).
        Also make sure you (as a user) have sufficient (read) permissions
        on your dvd drive (this could mean you either have to change the device
        permissions or add your user to a special group 
	(e.g. <command>addgroup cdrom username</command>),
        depending on your setup and/or distribution.
      </para>

      <para>
        It is highly recommended to switch DMA mode on for your DVD drive
        (without it even very recent machines will have trouble producing
        smooth video output). Use a command like
        <command>hdparm -d 1 device</command>
        on your dvd device. Please note that even if you're using ide-scsi
        you will have to set the dma flag on the ide device node (e.g. 
        <filename>/dev/hdc</filename>), not the mapped <filename>/dev/scd</filename>
        scsi device.
      </para>

      <para>
        To be able to play back encrypted dvds you need to have
        libdvdcss installed on your system (please check if this is legal where
        you live).
      </para>

      <para> 
        Newer (post-2000) dvd drives (so-called RPC-2 drives) check the dvd
        region, which means they'll prevent you from playing back dvds that have
        a different region code from what the drive is set up for (most drives
        come with a factory setting of region 0 so they can only play back
        region 0 dvds and there are not many of those available). The easiest
        way to handle this is to use the regionset utility from
        <ulink url="http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvd/dvd_disc_20000215.tar.gz">
        http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvd/dvd_disc_20000215.tar.gz</ulink>.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once you have everything set up, try something like
	<command> gxine dvd:// </command> or <command> xine -p dvd:// </command>
	to start dvd playback. Some frontend also offer so-called autoplay
	buttons or menu entries that start dvd playback immediately. 
      </para>

      <para>
        Important: do not try to mount the DVD. Just insert it and hit the DVD autoplay
	button or start xine from the command line.
      </para>

      <para>
        If things do not work as expected, try running the <command> xine-check </command>
	shellscript that comes with libxine to see if this gives you further hints on
	what could be wrong.
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
       <title> DVD playback works, but it takes a long time until playback starts </title>
       <para>
         This points to a region code problem. Some versions of libdvdcss can play
	 back DVDs from other regions than the RPC-2 DVD drive is set up for,
	 but this usually means a cryptographic attack (which takes time) has
	 to be used to access the DVD.

    <title> Can I watch Video CDs (VCDs)? SVCDS ? CD-i?</title>

    <para>
      xine supports VCD and SVCD playback out-of-the box. Similar to DVDs,
      make sure you have a <filename>/dev/cdrom</filename> alias pointing
      to your CDROM drive which you will use to play back the (S)VCD.
    </para>

    <title> Can I watch Quicktime (.mov, .mp4) files using xine? </title>

    <para>
       Quicktime is just a system layer (container format) which can contain various 
       different audio and video formats. The system layer itself is fully supported
       in xine. However, only very few typically used quicktime audio/video codecs
       are natively supported yet. Luckily, if you are using a x86 compatible machine
       (any recent PC hardware should do) you can install and use the original
       Quicktime DLLs and watch most streams (trailers) that can be downloaded from the net.
    </para>

    <para>
       Possibly the most convenient way to get the Quicktime DLLs is to download
       them from the mplayer website 
       <ulink url="http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/">
       http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/</ulink>.
       The package is called "QuickTime5 DLLs". Unpack it and move everything you find
       inside to <filename>/usr/lib/win32</filename> (actually you can place them
       anywhere you want, e.g. someplace in your homedirectory, but then you'll
       have to set <parameter>codec.win32_path</parameter> in your
       xine config file accordingly). Restart xine then and you should be
       able to watch Quicktime trailers.

    <title> Real Network files/streams </title>
    
    <sect2>
      <title> Can I watch Real (.rm, .ram) files using xine ? </title>

      <para>
        The situation with real files and streams is pretty similar to the situation
	with Quicktime Streams (see above). Most newer real audio and video formats
	are only supported by using binary-only codecs which are available from
	real networks but are not included in xine.
      </para>

      <para>
        One way to get these codecs is to download and install RealPlayer from
	RealNetworks, for example in <filename>/usr/local/RealPlayer8</filename> or
	<filename>/opt/RealPlayer8</filename>. If you installed it in one of these
	places, xine should automatically find and use the real binary codecs.
	If it doesn't work, try to find out the exact path to where the real codecs
	are installed on your system (look for a file named <filename>rv30.so.6.0</filename>
	which should reside in a directory called <filename>Codecs</filename> in the
	directory where you have installed RealPlayer in) and set
	<parameter>codec.real_codecs_path</parameter> in your xine config file
	accordingly.

      <title> What about (live) network streams (pnm://, rtsp:// style urls) ? </title>

      <para>
        xine supports both pnm and rtsp streaming. However, digging out the actual
	pnm/rtsp url can be tricky as they're often packed into heavy JavaScript and
	HTML code on most websites. You can either use a combination of your
	browser's "save source" function and wget or use a xine browser plugin
	(currently the gxine frontend comes with a simple mozilla plugin,
	for example). When you decided to dig out the url by hand don't get fooled
	by the many redirectors that are often placed around the actual url.
	Use wget to download any http://-style urls and use less to look inside
	the downloaded .ra/.ram files where you will find the actual pnm/rtsp
	url which can be opened using xine.

    <para>
      While the container format (system layer) ASF (wmv is just an alias)
      is fully supported in xine, for newer windows media 8 and 9 based streams
      you'll need to install windows binary codecs (.DLLs).
    </para>

    <para>
       Possibly the most convenient way to get the windows DLLs is to download
       them from the mplayer website 
       <ulink url="http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/">
       http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/</ulink>.
       The package is called "Win32 Codecpack". Unpack it and move everything you find
       inside to <filename>/usr/lib/win32</filename> (actually you can place them

       have to set <parameter>codec.win32_path</parameter> in your

	    You can enable xine's audio compressor. Most frontends have
	    a settings window and in that you'll find a slider for the
	    compressor setting. The values are percent values, so a 
	    slider setting of 200 means that xine will double the volume

    <title>Can xine produce 4-/5-channel surround audio output?</title>
    
    <para>
      Yep, it can do that using OSS or ALSA drivers, provided that the driver
      supports it. On startup xine tells you what modes are supported by your
      audio driver, e.g:
      <programlisting>
        audio_alsa_out : supported modes are mono stereo (4-channel not enabled
          in xine config) (5-channel not enabled in xine config) (5.1-channel not
          enabled in xine config) (a/52 and DTS pass-through not enabled in xine
          config)
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      On this machine 4-channel surround would be possible. However, since xine
      cannot detect if there are actually speakers connected to the additional
      channels, you'll have to activate that feature manually.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can do this either in the config dialog while xine is running (press
      the config button on the xine panel and go to the AUDIO tab) or have it
      the complicated way by editing the config file yourself which is located
      in your home directory in <filename>.gxine</filename>/<filename>.xine</filename>:
      <programlisting>
        # 4-channel:
          audio.four_channel:1
 
        # 5-channel:
          audio.five_channel:1

      surround (see above). You can either use the config dialog or edit
      the config file (<filename>~/.xine/config</filename>/<filename>~/.gxine/config</filename>) 
      yourself:

      API, for example, doesn't offer any volume property to applications.
      Similarly, with ac3 pass through it is not possible to set the volume.

    <title>Some parts of my X Desktop get transparent when xine plays the video!</title>
    
    <para>
      Looks like some colors on your GUI match the colorkey Xv uses. You can
      change the colorkey value to avoid this. There should be a line like:
      <programlisting>
        video.XV_COLORKEY:2110
      </programlisting>
      in your <filename>~/.xine/config</filename> file where you can change the color that's used
      by xine for the video overlay.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>

    <title>The aspect ratio of the video is wrong!</title>
    
    <para>
    Try pressing "a" to change the aspect ratio
    </para>

    <title>What is the difference between discarded and skipped frames?</title>
    
    <para>
    Sometimes xine will output a message like that:
    <programlisting>
    200 frames delivered, XX frames skipped, YY frames discarded
    </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      The difference between these counters is a little subtle for the non
      developer. There are two threads running in order to display video:
      the decoder thread will deliver frames to the video output thread. 
      The later is responsible for scheduling the frames to be displayed at
      the right time.
    </para>
    <para>
      If your system can't keep up with decoding requirements, decoder will
      deliver overdue frames. Imagine if it finished decoding the frame
      tagged for displaying at 11:30 but xine clock marks 11:31. When this
      situation is detected, xine will try to skip decoding a few frames
      to recover. Not every decoder may support this feature.
    </para>
    <para>
      When the frame is decoded to be shown somewhere in future but the
      output thread doesn't get scheduled in time by the operating system
      to complete the operation, the frame is discarded. One cause might
      be the disk access operation, which may halt the system for a few
      miliseconds without DMA. See section above.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that if a decoder can't skip frames for some reason, you would
      never see frames skipped (they would be all discarded).

  <title> Error Messages: What they mean and what you can do</title>

    <title>Starting xine fails with complains about audio drivers/devices!</title>
    
    <para>
      You can select the audio driver using the -A option. So try:
      <programlisting>
        xine -A null
      </programlisting>
      If you have ALSA drivers installed, try:
      <programlisting>
        xine -A alsa
      </programlisting>
      If you run ESD (not recommended), try:
      <programlisting>
        xine -A esd
      </programlisting>
      If you run artsd, try:
      <programlisting>
        xine -A arts
      </programlisting>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>

    <title>"no video port found"</title>
    
    <para>
      You got the Xv extension, but your video card driver doesn't support it.
      First try to find a driver that does support Xv on your hardware (check
      your graphics card vendor). If your driver has Xv support but you can't
      get it working, try at a lower resolution (1024x768 is enough even for
      anamorphic mpeg-2).    
    </para>
    <para>
      If all that fails, you can still use plain X11/XShm:
      <programlisting>
        gxine -V XShm foo.vob
      </programlisting>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>

    <title>"Unable to open dvd drive (/dev/dvd)" </title>
    
    <para>
      You probably don't have /dev/dvd (check that). If so, simply create a
      link /dev/dvd that points to your DVD device. Something like...
      <programlisting>
        cd /dev
        ln -s hdc dvd
      </programlisting>
       ...should do the job. Also make sure you have read access on
       the device the symlink points to.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>

    <title>"demux error! 00 00 00 (should be 0x000001)"</title>
    
    <para>
      Probably xine can't access your input source. Most commonly this happens
      when you're trying to play locked/encrypted DVDs. Remember that xine
      can't play such DVDs out-of-the box for legal reasons (see above).
    </para>
    <para>
      If it is legal where you life, you can try to install libdvdcss. Once
      you have done that and re-start xine, it should automatically detect
      and use it to play back encrypted DVDs.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another reason could be that your (RPC-2) DVD drive isn't set up
      for the right region (see above).
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>

    <title>"audio driver 'oss' failed, using null driver instead"</title>
    
    <para>
       First of all, make sure that your OSS Audio drivers are working (i.e.
       you can play music with other software). Maybe you're using alsa?
       If so, try <command> gxine -A alsa </command> to see if this helps.
    </para>
    <para>
      The most common reason for oss not working is that some other program is accesing
      your audio device. If you're using linux, the command <command>fuser /dev/dsp</command>
      should give you the PID of the process.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are using GNOME, chances are that this is caused by ESD. Now you
      have two possibilities. Either deactivate ESD (temporarily) by right
      clicking on the sound monitor applet and selecting "Place Esound in
      standby" or just kill it. Then xine will use OSS audio output. The other
      method is to make xine use ESD for audio output with:      
      <programlisting>
        gxine -A esd
      </programlisting>
      This may result in worse playback - exact syncronization is not possible
      with esd, so using oss should be preferred.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are using KDE, there is the possibility that the aRts sound
      daemon is currently running and thus blocking your sound device. You
      can check that by starting the aRts control (in your KDE menu it should
      be under Multimedia). If it is running, you can either use the aRts
      audio output plugin:
      <programlisting>
        gxine -A arts
      </programlisting>
      Or you suspend the aRts daemon by checking the appropriate option in
      your aRts control. (recommended)
    </para>
    <para>
      Newer versions of arts have an auto-suspend mode - this can lead to
      some nondeterministic behaviour of xine if it is set up to use
      the audio device directly. Using arts is recommended in that case,
      however you will loose the ability to do four/five channel audio output.
    </para>

    <title>"video_out: throwing away image with pts xxx because it's too old"</title>
    
    <para>
      This is a performance related problem.
      
      If you have a fast computer and this message shows from time to
      time playing dvd/cdrom, it's very likely that your drive is not
      DMA enabled. 
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>

    <title>"No video plugin available to decode 'xxxxxx'."</title>
    
    <para>
      You have tried to play a stream using a unknown or unhandled codec.
      Possibly the file uses some obscure proprietary format and no
      information is available on how to decode it.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you're on an x86 platform (e.g. PC hardware) you might want to
      try installing binary-only windows medial, real networks and
      quicktime codecs (see above).
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>

    <title>"w32codec: decoder failed to start. Is 'xxxxxx' installed?"</title>
    
    <para>
      You probably don't have the win32 dll needed to decode this file.

    <title>xine just crashed on me - i didn't get any error message</title>
    
    <para>
      OK, yes, that shouldn't happen and you're upset. We can understand that.
      But, to help you and of course to fix this, we need some information.
      So, let's go through the checklist and maybe prepare a nice bug report
      for the xine-user mailing list:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  did xine really crash (segfault) or did it hang (deadlock) ?
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  can you reproduce the bug? (e.g. do you remember what you
	  did and when you do it again it crashes again?) 
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  check the console output (and include it in a bug report), maybe earlier
	  there is some output that points to the problem.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  Your X server just froze on you? unfortunately that's a know problem
	  with some chipsets and drivers (most commonly Savage chipsets) when
	  using Xv. You might want to try running <command> gxine -V XShm </command>
	  to see if the problem is related to the Xv driver.  This will unfortunately 
	  be much slower, as lots of things are now done
	  in software instead of hardware scaling/colour space conversion.
	</para>
	<para>
  	  Maybe at the time you read this, there's an XFree upgrade which fixes
          this for the Savage driver. If that works for you, please notify the xine crew at
	  <email> xine-user@lists.sf.net </email>, so they can update this FAQ!
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  Even though we try to make each release as bug free as possible, xine is
          still under heavy development (nice excuse, isn't it? *grin*).
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you write to the xine user mailing list 
	  <email>xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net</email>
	  make sure you include a the above information (when applicable)
	  and also some information about your machine (operating system, cpu type and
	  speed, gfx card, sound card, ...) and please use a meaningfull subject
	  line ("xine bug" is bad, "xine fails to play this quicktime trailer in fullscreen mode"
	  ist much better).
	</para>
	<para>
          Thanks for taking the time to help improve xine.
