  1). Run autogen.sh: ./autogen.sh (this will configure xine-lib to install
      to /usr/local/lib). You can change this location and other flags.
      Look at ./configure --help for more options.

  2). Configure xine-lib running "./configure <configure flags>" if
      necessary.

  3). Run "make" to start building an optimized version.
  
      OR
  
      Run "make debug" to start building a debug version.

  4) Run "make install" to install xine-lib to the desired directory.
     If nothing was done this directory should be /usr/local/lib.

  5) Ensure that the desired directory path, e.g. /usr/local/lib, is
     in ld.so.conf. If not enter it and re-run ldconfig:

     ldconfig -v
