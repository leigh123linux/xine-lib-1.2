        xine-lib FAQ
   ----------------------


how do I build this beast?
--------------------------

first make sure you use a stable, official release of gcc to compile.
You can try patched gcc versions, but these are not supported and will 
probably not work (pgcc for example is known to make libmpeg break).

./cvscompile.sh  <--- only neccessary if you checked xine out of CVS
./configure
make
make install


how can I supply additional CFLAGS for the compilation ?
--------------------------------------------------------

you can do so by setting the GLOBAL_CFLAGS variable and then run 
configure again.

This can be usefull to specify additional include paths or library 
paths to the compiler. Example:

export GLOBAL_CFLAGS="-I/usr/include -L/home/guenter/xine_libs"


Are there binaries for my K7 available? Can I build them?
---------------------------------------------------------

At the moment we do not provide K7 binaries, since the latest
stable gcc version (2.92.2 at the time of this writing) doesn't
have K7 support. Use the 686 binaries instead. These binaries 
should run ok and will use 3DNow!

If you have a newer gcc you can try to compile "more" k7 support
in (esp. better instruction sheduling). If the configure script
should fail to detect your processor/gcc correctly, try setting the 
XINE_BUILD envvar explicitly to a valid description string for 
your configuration, e.g.

export XINE_BUILD=k7-pc-linux-gnu
rm -f config.cache
./autogen.sh
make
make install


where and how do I get the latest development version?
------------------------------------------------------

check it out of our CVS:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.xine.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine login

<empty password>

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.xine.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine co xine-lib


I think I found a bug!
