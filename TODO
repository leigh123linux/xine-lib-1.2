The road to xine-lib 1.0
========================

this only relates to the xine engine (xine-lib), not xine
frontends


required for 1.0
----------------

- update xine hacker's guide
- update / rewrite xine HOWTO (stefan, guenter)
- xine bug tracking system?
- fix stream end detection for real streams
- fix mpeg elementary stream playback (especially logo streams
  with only one frame)
- clean up config options

optional
--------

- double-check rate estimation in demux_mgeg/mpeg_block
- log/verbose output macros
- fix cook audio streaming
- better dvd error messages
- fix streaming of small files (e.g. http) 

- rtp / rtsp support:

  - input_rtp
  - rtsp support (currently only real's rtsp derivate is implemented)
  - isma/apple streaming server support (mpeg4ip.sf.net)
  - find out what all those people requesting rtp/multicast/... support
    really want and how to implement it :)
  - videolan streaming server support
  - helix streaming server support

- detect broken savage drivers in health check, disable Xv in that case
- id3v2 (guenter)
- directfb video output plugin
- reduce memory footprint (e.g. variable fifo buffer sizes...)
- bring dxr3 video out to work with aaxine (michael)
- Multiple DVD Subtitles displayed at the same time (jcdutton)
- Move read cache code from libdvdnav into input_dvd.c (jcdutton)
- Support DVD "Trick" modes. Super Fast forward/reverse (jcdutton)
- xvid decoder plugin 
- opengl video output plugin (matthias, sopra at stuttgart university)
- irix audio output plugin (matthias)
- support changing channel for V4L (event already defined in xine.h)

Open Tasks
==========

- port to other OS (Net/OpenBSD, hurd ...?)
- MicroDVD input plugin
- video output synced to vertical blank
  preferably without requiring
  root privileges (XSync extension? MAS?)
- direct playback of vcd images
- resolve issues with ffmpeg's live http streaming server
- videolan streaming support
- MAS support (http://www.mediaapplicationserver.net)
- nonlinear video editing and compositing frontend (michael) => enix
- stream format conversion frontend => enix


xine's future
=============

- implement lots of audio and video processing filters as post plugins, e.g.
  - scaling
  - colorspace conversion
  - deinterlacing (already done)
  - audio resampling
  - compressor
  ...

  extend public api so post plugins are instantiated automatically when
  needed, but keep explicit post plugin rewiring functions for advanced
  video processing frontends 

- see what kind of cooperation can be set up with other media player projects
  - mike will look into moving xine's decoder api closer to the one
    ffmpeg uses
  - check out other media players
  - output, demuxer plugins
