Open Tasks
==========

- SDL based video and audio output plugins
  I've seen patches about this before but with the monolitic xine
  this would have ment xine to become SDL-dependant. But now,
  with our flexible dynamic audio/video plugin architecture
  this is no longer a problem
- fbdev based video output plugin
- a win32 port, based on the SDL output plugins
- a decoder plugin that uses xanim's quicktime codec plugins
  (pretty much like the libwin32) this could enable 3ivx support btw
- port to other OS (Net/OpenBSD, Win32 ...?)
- deinterlace filters
- asd support
- xine hacker's guide
- MicroDVD support
- timed script subtitle support (various formats)
- video output synced to vertical blank
