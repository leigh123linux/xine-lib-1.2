Open Tasks
==========

- make win32 codecs work again
- fix the subtitle decoder
- a qt/kde gui
- an OpenDivX decoder plugin (should be very easy)
- port over from OMS / implement a Mpeg Transport Stream demultiplexer
- an aalib video output plugin (coolness factor: +10! ;))
- SDL based video and audio output plugins
  I've seen patches about this before but with the monolitic xine
  this would have ment xine to become SDL-dependant. But now,
  with our flexible dynamic audio/video plugin architecture
  this is no longer a problem
- fbdev based video output plugin
- a win32 port, based on the SDL output plugins
- a quicktime demuxer
- a decoder plugin that uses xanim's quicktime codec plugins
  (pretty much like the libwin32) this could enable 3ivx support btw
- port to other platforms (ppc, sparc...) - the architecture isn't
  final yet, but I really hope that there are only minor changes
  (mainly additions) to come
- port to other OS (Free/Net/OpenBSD, IRIX, Solaris, Win32 ...?)
- deinterlace filters
