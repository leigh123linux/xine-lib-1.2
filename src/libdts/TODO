Todo list for software dts core (48Khz PCM, not 96Khz PCM) decode.
1) Enter all the huffman tables.
2) Get InverseQ to parse the input stream via the huffman tables.
3) We don't have the "Prediction Coefficients VQ" for ADPCM, so we might never get software decode working. Any help here would be very welcome!!!
4) Move over the sync detection and packet joining code from liba52 and modify it to recognise dts.
5) Get all the parsing code to compile and work correctly. Requires (1) and (2) first.
6) Work out what the LookUp function needs to do.
