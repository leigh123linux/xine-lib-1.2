xine-lib (0.9.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU.
  * Added ia64 support to configure.in.
  * For performance reasons, the shared libs are not compiled with
    -fPIC in the standard distribution, which is incorrect behavior.
    As a compromise, I've added a "--disable-fpic" configure option
    which will only do this on platforms where this is allowed.
    Closes: #115006.
  * m4/xine.m4: autoconf test uses strdup w/o including string.h.
    Closes: #115271.
  * Don't install aclocal files in /usr/local in libxine-dev.
    Closes: #115033.
  * Fixed typo in src/video_out/deinterlace.c.  Closes: #112748.
