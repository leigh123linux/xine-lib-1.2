xine-lib (0.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * now building alsa09 plugin (instead of alsa05, as you can't have
                                libasound{1,2}-dev at the same time...)
  * build-Dependancy on liblircclient-dev => lirc support on non-i386
  * new upstream release
    * deinterlace.c should compile everywhere (closes: #112748)
    * including string.h in m4 test (closes: #115271)
    * aclocal file is in /usr/share/aclocal (just as 0.9.1)  (closes: #115033)
    * enables -fPIC on all architectures except i386 (closes: #115006)
    * many more fixes/features (see upstream changelog)

xine-lib (0.9.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU.
  * Added ia64 support to configure.in.
  * For performance reasons, the shared libs are not compiled with
    -fPIC in the standard distribution, which is incorrect behavior.
    As a compromise, I've added a "--disable-fpic" configure option
    which will only do this on platforms where this is allowed.
    Closes: #115006.
  * m4/xine.m4: autoconf test uses strdup w/o including string.h.
    Closes: #115271.
  * Don't install aclocal files in /usr/local in libxine-dev.
    Closes: #115033.
  * Fixed typo in src/video_out/deinterlace.c.  Closes: #112748.

  * bugfix release of the package
  * added build-depends for zlib1g-dev (closes: #112270)

    compile... (closes: #112257)
