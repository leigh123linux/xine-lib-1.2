    - Add debian/watch file for uscan.
    - Convert debian/copyright to UTF-8.
    - Add build-deps on libxv-dev and libvcdinfo-dev.
    - Bump standards version to 3.6.2 (no changes *yet* - CHECK THIS)
    - Make "post-Sarge"-tagged changes to debian/rules and strip debian/tmp/
      from debian/*.install.
    - Remove *.gmo on clean (Just In Case).
    - Do a little preparation for a possible -dbg package.
  * Acknowledge NMUs.

xine-lib (1.0.1-1.3) unstable; urgency=low
  * Non-maintainer upload.

  * Backport patch from 1.0.2 that fixes hard hang-ups when a plugin listed in
    ~/.xine/catalog.cache becomes unloadable (closes: #328454). Plugins can   
    become unloadable if DT_NEEDED libraries get uninstalled, which is
    possible because the package lists many of these libraries in the 
    Recommends or Suggests fields only. With this fix, amarok should not
    freeze with the XINE engine anymore (closes: #327203), and totem either
    (closes: #328265).

    Patch included in debian/patches/fix-hangs-at-load-time.diff, but since
    there's no patch applying code in debian/rules, it's present in the
    .diff.gz as well.

  * Fix the script that invokes dpkg-shlibdeps to split dependencies among
    Depends, Recommends, and Suggests: it generated empty fields if one of the
    expected plugins was not actually available. (Closes: #328184)

    This means that now the package now suggests libgnomevfs2-0 (closes:
    #326935) and libflac7 (closes: #328168). Submitters may wish to reopen if
    they want a discussion with the maintainer about the need of these being 
    strong Depends instead of Suggests.

  * xineplug_flac.so now links against libflac7 instead of libflac6, which
    closes: #325960 (the FLAC transition bug).

xine-lib (1.0.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Medium-urgency upload for RC bugfixes.
  * Multiple fixes for compatibility with gcc 4.0 strictness
    (closes: #288189, #318838)
  * This rebuild also gets rid of the dependency on libslang1
    (closes: #315986); it only trades it for libslang2 unfortunately, 
    since libcaca is a static lib.
  * Build-Depend on libaa1-dev instead of the removed aalib1-dev
    (closes: #320317).
  * Build-Depend on libxinerama-dev instead of on xlibs-static-dev,
    which no longer provides this lib; it should be rolled back into
    xlibs-dev as a dependency eventually, but build-depending on it 
    directly is sensible anyway.
  * Disentangle xine from libraries it doesn't actually use directly, so
    that the dependency tree is less brittle and requires fewer rebuilds
    in the future (e.g., it currently has a dependency on libstdc++5
    that it shouldn't need at all); this is doubly important since some
    plugins aren't mentioned at all in the dependencies, and so can be 
    left unusable by library changes:
    - relibtoolize the package to use the Debian version of libtool,
      with support for pruning indirect dependencies from the linker
      commandline
    - as part of the above, add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to configure.ac to
      avoid any need for autotools build-dependencies
    - hard-code -lmodplug, -lartsc, and -lgnomevfs-2, because pkg-config,
      artsc-config, etc. spit out lib dependencies that are spurious on  
      GNU/* systems.

xine-lib (0.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * now building alsa09 plugin (instead of alsa05, as you can't have
                                libasound{1,2}-dev at the same time...)
  * build-Dependancy on liblircclient-dev => lirc support on non-i386

xine-lib (0.9.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU.
  * Added ia64 support to configure.in.
  * For performance reasons, the shared libs are not compiled with
    -fPIC in the standard distribution, which is incorrect behavior.
    As a compromise, I've added a "--disable-fpic" configure option
    which will only do this on platforms where this is allowed.
    Closes: #115006.
  * m4/xine.m4: autoconf test uses strdup w/o including string.h.
    Closes: #115271.
  * Don't install aclocal files in /usr/local in libxine-dev.
    Closes: #115033.
  * Fixed typo in src/video_out/deinterlace.c.  Closes: #112748.

    compile... (closes: #112257)
