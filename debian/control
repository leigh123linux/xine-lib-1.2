Description: the xine video player library, development packages
 This contains development files (headers, documentation and the like)
 for the xine library (libxine).
 .
 Libxine provides the complete infrastructure for a video/media player.
 It supports MPEG 1/2 and (with suitable W*ndows DLLs) AVI/DivX videos
 out of the box, so you can use it to play DVDs, (S)VCDs and most video
 files out there. Building a GUI (or text based) frontend around this should
 be quite easy. The xine-ui package provides one for your convenience,
 so you can just start watching your VCDs ;-)
